    "content": "<p>AI bots are Evil. Vercel Firewall is a disaster. Should I switch ?</p>\n<p>Short story long : <strong>AI bots and crawlers started sucking hard on my app.</strong> I'm currently on Vercel Hobby plan and have around 350 Monthly Active Users.</p>\n<p>That being said, I started to receive warnings from Vercel about usage and... here's what I found : <strong>AI bots and crawlers are HUNGRY.</strong> HORRIBLY HUNGRY (see below)</p>\n<p>Problem : you can block the \"nice\" bots with robots.txt, but evil ones won't care (like Alibaba, see below). Already disallowed some bots from my robots.txt.</p>\n<p>Problem nÂ°2 : with Vercel's firewall, if you set a custom rule to deny based on user agent, JA4 or something else... <strong>you'll still be charged for that.</strong></p>\n<p>Now look at my firewall dashboard :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/59vybxczcipe1.png?width=1380&#x26;format=png&#x26;auto=webp&#x26;s=7d31acd0cc7f6e5b9395066bac0d33561572b2f9\">About 50&#x26;#37; of traffic Is Alibaba bot I deny by JA4. I'm still charged for this.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gj1qwub0dipe1.png?width=1380&#x26;format=png&#x26;auto=webp&#x26;s=18b8790e0c26b2e5e39fa41f74eb997b49c99c65\">About 70&#x26;#37; of allowed traffic is another both. I could block it, but I would still be charged for this.</a></p>\n<p>This is getting ridiculous.<br>\nVercel documentation says that \"permanent actions\" avoid being charged, but <strong>they are not available in the product anymore</strong>.</p>\n<p>So my question is : what are my options ?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Put a <strong>proxy/firewall</strong> in front of Vercel ? User a product or self hosted.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Cloudflare</strong> for caching and firewall ? (about 20$/month)</li>\n<li><strong>Self Host</strong> (already have a VPS) instead of Vercel so I can have full control ? There should be an open source traffic management tooling I guess</li>\n<li>Go with <strong>pro plan with Vercel</strong> and use rate limiting ? (not perfect but still better I guess ?)</li>\n<li>Use another hosting service that allows this level of firewall configuration ?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How did you <strong>avoid being hammered</strong> and charged for bots by SaaS ?</p>\n<p>App built with NextJS15, SSR and ISR. All data queries cached.<br>\nGoogle Analytics says about 350-400 Monthly Active Users so far.</p>\n",

From what I've seen (especially with this alibaba devil, sorry for them) it only works on very short term. That means that with an appropriate rule (like JA4 custom rule) they stop querying after few hours instead of querying for 20h non stop. Problem is that they come back the next day. I haven't enough data yet to know if they give up after a month or so, but I'm still blocking them for now just for the sake of \"sending a message\" and try to trigger a \"give up on this domain\" effect on their side.</p>\n<p>That's still reducing the total amount, you're right, but I can't help but try to think of a longer term solution and always curious to learn new good practices and tips here :)</p>\n",
