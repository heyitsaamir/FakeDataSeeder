Performance profiling feels like black magic at first, but it's an incredibly useful skill and it's worth investing a bit of time to learn.</p>\n<p>These will want to attach to the Node process, and it's not obvious at first how to apply this to Next. What you can do is find the executable - usually `node_modules/next/dist/bin/next` - and run `node` with that file path as the argument, or whatever the tool's docs say.</p>\n<p>Example: `node ./node_modules/next/dist/bin/next dev`</p>\n",
