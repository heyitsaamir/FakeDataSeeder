If you're not sure how, here are a few tools that will help:\n\n0x: [https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x)\n\nClinic: [https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic](https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic)\n\nFlamebearer: [https://github.com/mapbox/flamebearer](https://github.com/mapbox/flamebearer)\n\nChrome dev tools: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/nodejs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/nodejs)\n\nOnce you profile and get some output, let me know if you'd like help interpreting the results. Performance profiling feels like black magic at first, but it's an incredibly useful skill and it's worth investing a bit of time to learn.\n\nThese will want to attach to the Node process, and it's not obvious at first how to apply this to Next. What you can do is find the executable - usually \\`node\\_modules/next/dist/bin/next\\` - and run \\`node\\` with that file path as the argument, or whatever the tool's docs say.\n\nExample: \\`node ./node\\_modules/next/dist/bin/next dev\\`",
